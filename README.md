Connect four of your game pieces in a row while preventing your opponent from doing the same!

**QuadConnect** is a game in which two players take turns dropping game pieces from the top of a seven-column, six-row game board. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of four of one's own game pieces.

## Controls
* Left Arrow  - Move one space left.
* Right Arrow - Move one space right.
* Down Arrow  - Drop game piece into current column.
* Up Arrow    - Reset game.

When a player successfully executes a **QuadConnect**, the background turns green and the winning pieces are highlighted!
